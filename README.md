This is the second assignment of TIPR-2019. The problems in this assignment builds an Optical Numeral Recognition (ONR) system using neural network. You have to design a MultiLayer Neural Network (MLNN) from scratch - everything starting from initialization, forward propagation and backward propagation(commonly coined as
back-prop) - without library (PyTorch or TensorFlow).
